    <h1>Description</h1>
    Gomoku, also called Gobang or Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board, using 15×15 of the 19×19 grid intersections.[1] Because pieces are not moved or removed from the board, Gomoku may also be played as a paper and pencil game. The game is known in several countries under different names.

    Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

      <h2>Origin</h2>
      It originated in Japan during the Heian period[citation needed]. The name "Gomoku" is from the Japanese language, in which it is referred to as gomokunarabe (五目並べ). Go means five, moku is a counter word for pieces and narabe means line-up. The game is also popular in Korea, where it is called omok (오목 [五目]) which has the same structure and origin as the Japanese name.

      The Japanese call this game Go-moku (five stones). In the nineteenth century, the game was introduced to Britain where it was known as Go Bang, said to be a corruption of the Japanese word goban, said to be adopted from Chinese k'i pan (qí pán) "chess-board."[2]

    <h2><b>Official rules</b></h2>
    Besides many variations around the world, the Swap2 rule (based on "swap" from Renju) is currently adapted in tournaments among professional players, including Gomoku World Championships.

In Swap2 rule, the first player places 3 stones (2 black 1 white, if black goes first) on the board, the second player has the choice to take black/white or to place 2 more stones to change the shape and let the first player choose color.[3] This is essentially a slightly more elaborate pie rule.

Swap2 solved the low complexity problem[4] and makes the game fairer. Like other rules and variations, 100% fairness can be reached by playing two alternating games for each point.

  <h2>Variations</h2>
  Most variations are based on either Free-style gomoku or Standard gomoku.
  <ul>
<li><b>Free-style gomoku</b> requires a row of five or more stones for a win.</li>
<li><b>Standard gomoku</b> requires a row of "exactly" five stones for a win: rows of six or more, called <b>overlines</b>, do not count.</li>

  <h2>Optional ("house") rules</h2>
  Black (the player who makes the first move) was long known to have a big advantage, even before L. Victor Allis proved that black could force a win (see below). So a number of variations are played with extra rules that aimed to reduce black's advantage.
  <ul>
    <li>The rule of three and three bans a move that simultaneously forms two open rows of three stones (rows not blocked by an opponent's stone at either end).<li>
    <li>The rule of <b>four and four</b> bans a move that simultaneously forms two rows of four stones (open or not).</li>
    <li>Alternatively, a handicap may be given such that after the first "three and three" play has been made, the opposing player may place two stones as their next turn. These stones must block an opponent's row of three.</li>
    <li>Efforts to improve fairness by reducing first-move advantage include the rule of swap, generalizable as "swap-(x,y,z)" and characterizable as a partially compounded and partially iterated version of the pie rule ("one person slices; the other chooses"): One player places on the board x stones of the first-moving color and a lesser number y stones of the second-moving color ("slicing" in the pie metaphor); the other player is entitled to choose between a) playing from the starting position, in which case the selecting player is also entitled to choose which color to play, and b) placing z (usually [(x - y) + 1]) more stones on the board at locations of that player's choice ("reslicing" in the pie metaphor, with limitations created by the board's existing setup akin to limitations arising from the existing slices in the pie), in which case the former player is entitled to choose which color side to play.</li>
  </ul>
